# Smart Security Systems

Description:

In this project, we are building a smart home security IoT system. We programmed a motion sensor that detects a movement which triggers a camera to continuously take pictures of the object. Pictures taken will be analyzed on the server where we detect if the object is actually a human and from a known family members. If the object is unrecognized, the server will send an SMS notification to the home owners with a link to view the pictures. The home owners will be given an option to make appropriate actions such as calling 911.

I did this project with two other engineers at a Hackathon. The other two engineers were working on the embedded software for the micro-controller (unfortunately, the code was not merged to this project) and I was mostly working on the server handler, and a little bit of client viewer (for viewing the pictures).

Tools used:
- Python
- Node.js
- STDLib (FaaS)
- AWS
- React.js
- Material-UI (React based UI lilbrary).
- Microsoft Face API.
